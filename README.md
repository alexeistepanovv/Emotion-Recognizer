# Emotion Recognition Project

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a neural network-based system for emotion recognition from images. Utilizing TensorFlow and Keras, the project explores various architectures including VGG16, ResNet, and EfficientNetV2 for this purpose.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
- Implementation of multiple neural network architectures.
- Training scripts with detailed epoch-wise metrics.
- Diagnostic plots for model performance evaluation.

## Structure
- `ANN_script.py`: Main script for training and evaluating models.
- `model_functions.py`: Contains functions for model building, training, and plotting diagnostics.
- `module.py`: Utility functions including image size retrieval.
- `preproccess_and_EDA.py`: Script for data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
- `settings.py`: Configuration settings for the project.
- `data.csv`: Dataset used for training the models.
